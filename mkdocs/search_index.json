Read more about how to \nauthorize Bitrise\n.\n\n\nThe reason behind the need for being authorized, is that Bitrise has to have a working SSH connection to your repository to be able to clone it. There are several ways to make it work. Automatically, by adding it manually, or by using your own key.\n\n\n\n\nUse SSH URLs everywhere\n\n\nMost services support SSH key based authentication \nonly\n for SSH URLs (ex: \ngit@github.com:bitrise-io/bitrise.git\n), and \nnot\n for HTTPS URLs (ex: \nhttps://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.git\n)! This means, that \nevery private repository you want to use have to be addressed with the SSH URL\n. If you have direct private git repo references in your \nPodfile\n you'll have to use the SSH URL there as well!

Note that if you store files which are downloaded from a CDN / cloud storage you might not see any improvement, as downloading it from the Bitrise Build Cache storage will probably take about the same time as downloading it from its canonical CDN / cloud storage location. However Bitrise Caching still might help if you have reliability issues with the resource's, or dependency's canonical download location.\n\n\nSetup\n\u2693\n\n\nAll you need to get started is adding two Steps to your Workflow:\n\n\n\n\nOne for downloading the previous cache (if any): \nCache:Pull\n\n\nOne for checking the state of the cache and uploading it if required: \nCache:Push\n\n\n\n\nYou should add the \nCache:Pull\n (download) step right before you'd use the cache. For example, in case of an iOS app, this can be between the \nGit Clone\n and the \nCocoaPods\n install steps. If you intend to cache your \n./Pods\n directory you should not pull the cache before the \nGit Clone\n, because \nGit Clone\n will create the base directory for \n./Pods\n. Before the \nGit Clone\n step your code (and the directories your code creates when git cloned) is not available on the Virtual Machine.\n\n\nThe \nCache:Push\n step can be the very last step in the Workflow. The only thing you have to care about is that it should be after the step(s) which update the cached paths. For example in case of \nCocoaPods\n you should put the \nCache:Push\n step anywhere after the \nCocoaPods\n install, because that's the step which generates, or updates the directory (\n./Pods\n) which is cached.\n\n\nTechnical notes\n\u2693\n\n\nThe Build Cache feature is split into two parts, the \nBuild Cache API\n and the \nSteps\n.\n\n\nThe \nBuild Cache API\n is actually a really simple API, with only one responsibility: you can request a download or an upload URL from the API. Of course it also makes sure that you have the required access rights to the resource (Build Cache Archive), but other than that its only responsibility is providing the secure - time limited and expiring - download and upload URLs. It does not process the files.\n\n\nThe \nSteps\n are the place where the \"magic\" happens. The whole logic of comparing caches to see if there was any relevant change and creating the cache archives is done by the Steps. This also means that you can write your own Steps and implement your own comparison and compression logic. The step just has to use the Build Cache API to get download and upload URLs, there's no restriction on the cache file format or on its content.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced notes\n\n\n\n\nYou can create your own Cache steps\n\n\nYou can create and use your own Build Cache server and API\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloading and deleting caches\n\u2693\n\n\nYou can download and delete caches, for every branch which generated a cache, on the \nSettings\n tab of the app, under the \nManage Build Caches\n section.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can see the size of the caches and the last time a given cache was used in the popup.",

E.g. instead of:\n  \nlet app = XCUIApplication()\n  ...\n  app.launch()\n\n  do: \nXCUIApplication().launch()\n\n\nSome users had success with splitting the tests into multiple Schemes,\n  and running those separately, with separate Test steps.\n\n\nA great article about splitting tests into multiple Schemes:\n  \nhttp://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/04/06/Testing-Schemes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes it's related to a code which makes Xcode to misbehave\n\n\nTry another Xcode version.\n\n\n\n\nFlaky UI tests, UI test cases failing randomly\n\u2693\n\n\nThis can happen with a really simple project too. Even something as\nsimple as:\n\n\nfunc testAddAnItemGoToDetailsThenDeleteIt() {\n        // Use recording to get started writing UI tests.\n        // Use XCTAssert and related functions to verify your tests produce the correct results.\n\n\n        let app = XCUIApplication()\n        let masterNavigationBar = app.navigationBars[\nMaster\n]\n        masterNavigationBar.buttons[\nAdd\n].tap()\n\n        let tablesQuery = app.tables\n        let firstElemQuery = tablesQuery.cells.elementBoundByIndex(0)\n        firstElemQuery.tap()\n        app.navigationBars.matchingIdentifier(\nDetail\n).buttons[\nMaster\n].tap()\n        masterNavigationBar.buttons[\nEdit\n].tap()\n\n        firstElemQuery.buttons.elementBoundByIndex(0).tap()\n        firstElemQuery.buttons[\nDelete\n].tap()\n\n        masterNavigationBar.buttons[\nDone\n].tap()\n\n        XCTAssert(tablesQuery.cells.count == 0)\n    }\n\n\n\n\ncan trigger this issue.\n\n\nPossible solutions\n\u2693\n\n\nWe could reproduce this issue with the code above, using \nXcode 7.3\n.\nThe exact same code worked perfectly with \nXcode 7.2.1\n while it randomly\nfailed with \n7.3\n. The solution was to use a different iOS Simulator device.\nThe test failed \n2 out of 3\n on average with the \"iPhone 6\" simulator device\nusing Xcode 7.3, while it worked perfectly with Xcode 7.2.1.\n\n\nChanging the simulator device to \"iPhone 6s Plus\" solved the issue with \nXcode 7.3\n.\n\n\nXcode Unit Test fails without any error, with exit code 65\n\u2693\n\n\nThis can be caused by a lot of things, Xcode or some other tool simply\nomits / does not present any error message.\n\n\nYou can find a long discussion, with possible reasons \n solutions \nhere\n.\n\n\nA quick summary:\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, if you use \nxcpretty\n to format the output try a build without it\n  (if you use the Xcode Test step you can set \nxcodebuild\n as the \"Output Tool\" option/input\n  to not to format the log produced by \nxcodebuild\n). The cause is: \nxcpretty\n sometimes\n  omits the error message in it's output. \nRelated GitHub issue\n.\n\n\nIf you don't use our \nXcode Test\n step to run your UI Test you should try to run\n  it with our Xcode Test step.

If you declare \ndeps\n \nfor a given Step\n,\nthe \nBitrise CLI\n\nwill check if that tool is installed, and will install it for you if required.\n\n\n\n\nAvailable dependency managers\n\n\nThis method is the preferred way of handling (step) dependencies, as the Bitrise CLI\nwill not (re)install the specified tool(s) if it's already available.\nThat said, there are tools which are not available in the supported dependency managers,\nor you need a version of the tool which is not available in the dependency manager.\nIn those cases you should simply install the tool inside the Script, as described above. \n\n\n\n\nAn example, installing \ncmake\n with either \napt-get\n (where \napt-get\n is available),\nor with \nbrew\n (on macOS):\n\n\ndeps:\n  brew:\n  - name: cmake\n  apt_get:\n  - name: cmake\n\n\n\n\nA minimal \nbitrise.yml\n for demonstration:\n\n\nformat_version: 1.2.0\ndefault_step_lib_source: https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib.git\n\nworkflows:\n  test:\n    steps:\n    - script:\n        deps:\n          brew:\n          - name: cmake\n          apt_get:\n          - name: cmake\n        inputs:\n          - content: |-\n              #!/bin/bash\n              set -ex\n              which cmake\n\n\n\n\nConditional execution\n\u2693\n\n\nAdditionally, you can use Environment Variables in your scripts too. As an example, using the base \nAvailable Environment Variables\n \nPR\n (but you can use any Environment Variable, like the ones exposed by previous steps in the Workflow), to run different scripts in case of a Pull Request and a non Pull Request build:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\nset -ex\n\nif [[ \n$PR\n == \ntrue\n ]] ; then\n  echo \n=\n Pull Request mode/build!\n\n  bash ./path/to/in-case-of-pull-request.sh\nelse\n  echo \n=\n Not Pull Request mode/build!\n\n  bash ./path/to/not-pull-request.sh\nfi\n\n\n\n\nNote: if you \ndon't\n want to run any part of the Step/script based on a variable (like \n$PR\n),\nyou don't have to implement the check in the script. You can use the \nrun_if\n expression in\nthe \nbitrise.yml\n directly to declare in which case(s) the Step should run. Additionally,\n\nrun_if\n can be added to any step, not just to Script steps.\nYou can find more information about \nrun_if\n expressions\nin \nthis guide\n.",
