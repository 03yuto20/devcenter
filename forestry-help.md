## Creating new articles with Forestry

1. Go to the `For review` section of the sidebar.
2. Click `Add new` on the top of the screen.
3. Choose a Front Matter Template. In most cases, the **basic template** works perfectly.
4. Add some content to the editor on the right, and click `Save draft`.

You can come back and edit the article any time. Please remember that every time you click `Save`, Forestry pushes a commit to GitHub. You can view your file in the DevCenter repository.

NOTE: it is recommended to create a new article in an external editor, such as Atom, and work on it there until it is ready for review. Ideally, you should only save a new article on Forestry when it's done - that way the entire new article is a single commit on GitHub.

## Updating an existing article

1. Create a new article in the `For review` section.
2. Copy the contents of the existing article into the new article.
3. Add your changes.

NOTE: Once again, it is recommended to edit the existing article in an external editor until it is ready for review. Once you are finished (the article is ready for review), copy the contents into the new article you created in the `For reviews` section. This is to ensure all changes are visible in a single commit.

## Getting an article reviewed

1. Save the article on Forestry - this creates a commit on GitHub so only save on Forestry when your content is ready for review.
2. Go to the [commits page of the DevCenter repository](https://github.com/bitrise-io/devcenter/commits/master) and find the commit or commits created when you saved the article. Its commit message should be "Updated article-name.md" or "Created article-name.md".

NOTE: if you have several articles ready for review, you will find each article in a separate commit.

1. Select and copy the links of the commits in your browser's address bar and add them to the review task(s) in ClickUp.
2. Move your writing tasks to _Blocked_ status.
