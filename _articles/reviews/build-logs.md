Build logs allow users to analyze their builds and find out what went wrong - and what went right! On Bitrise, build logs are easily accessible, they can be viewed on the website in their entirety or they can be downloaded to view them on your own device. 

### Finding a build log

When you run a build, a build log is generated automatically. Every build has its own log, with its own unique build log URL. The build log URL contains the build slug: a hexadecimal identifier for a specific build. 

1. Log in to Bitrise and click on your app on the Apps page.
2. Click the `Builds` tab. 
3. Select the build you want to check out.
4. Find the log under the `LOGS` tab.
