----

## PAYMENT AND RENEWAL

You may take out a subscription for optional paid services and features (any such services will be referred to as an "Upgrade") through the Website. To place an order for an Upgrade, follow the instructions set out on the Website. During this process you will be able to check and amend any errors before submitting your order to us.

Your order for the Upgrade is an offer by you to enter into a subscription for the Upgrade with us. We are under no obligation to accept your offer. We will notify you by email if we accept your offer at which point a contract will be formed between us in respect of your Upgrade.

By selecting an Upgrade you agree to subscribe to such Upgrade and to pay Bitrise the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated on the Website for that Upgrade. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated. Upgrade fees are not refundable other than in accordance with Clause 9. As Upgrades are part of the Services these Terms of Service apply to the Upgrades.

A valid credit card is required for paying subscription fees.

The service is billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis based on your choice selected on the Website. There will be no refunds or credits for partial use of a month’s or year’s service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months or years unused with an active account.

Downgrading your account may cause loss of content, features or capacity. Bitrise does not accept liability for such loss.

## AUTOMATIC RENEWAL

Unless you notify Bitrise before the end of the applicable subscription
period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your subscription
will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the
then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as
well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we
have on record for you. Upgrades can be cancelled at any time on the
**Account Settings** page.

----

## Modifications to the Services and Prices

The content available to be provided as part of the Services may change from time to time during your subscription.

Any new features that augment or enhance the current Services, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Services after any changes to the Services shall constitute your consent to such changes.

Prices of all Services, including but not limited to fees for the monthly subscription plan for the Services, are subject to change upon 30 days’ notice from us. If you do not agree to pay the increased prices, you may terminate this Agreement in accordance with Clause 18.5. Such notice may be provided at any time by e-mail, or by posting the changes to the Website ([www.bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io/)) or the Services itself.

----

## CANCELLATION AND REFUNDS FOR CONSUMERS

If you are a consumer, under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (the "Regulations") you have the right to cancel your Upgrade, for any reason, within 14 days of the date of your Upgrade (the “Cooling-off Period”).

If you wish to exercise your right to cancel in accordance with Clause 9.1, you must contact us to let us know that you are doing so. You may do this by emailing us at [letsconnect@bitrise.io](letsconnect@bitrise.io). We will send you an acknowledgement of receipt by email.

If you exercise your right of cancellation in accordance with Clause 9.1, this Agreement will come to an end and we will reimburse to you all payments received from you for your Upgrade.  We will make this reimbursement no later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel your Upgrade. We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment you use to pay for your Upgrade, unless you expressly agree otherwise.

If you wish to use the Upgrade during the Cooling-off Period then you may do so but:

  9.4.1. you expressly agree that we may begin to make the Upgrade available to you during the Cooling-Off Period; and

  9.4.2. you expressly acknowledge and agree that your right to cancel your Upgrade under the Regulations (as set out in Clause 9.1) will be lost.

## CONFIDENTIALITY

"Confidential Information" means any and all information or data, in whatever form or storage medium, whether tangible or intangible, and whether disclosed directly or indirectly before or after this Agreement by or on behalf of the Discloser to the Recipient in writing, orally, through visual means, or by the Recipient's evaluation, observation, analysis, inspection or other study of such information, data or knowledge, which is now or at any time after the date of this Agreement, owned or controlled by the Discloser. Confidential Information shall include any information which, by its nature, would reasonably be considered to be of a confidential nature either intrinsically or due to the context and circumstances in which it was disclosed.

"Discloser" means a party disclosing its Confidential Information to the Recipient.

"Recipient" means a party receiving Confidential Information from the Discloser.

The Recipient shall protect all Confidential Information which the Discloser provides to it (whether orally, in writing or in any other form) using the same standards as the Recipient applies to its own comparable Confidential Information but in no event less than reasonable measures.

This Clause ‎16 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement.

In the case of such termination or such suspension lasting more than 30 calendar days, we shall refund you, on a pro rata basis, the prices paid by you for any Upgrade that are for the portion of your Upgrade remaining after termination, or suspension of your Upgrade occurs.

We may cancel your access to the Services at any time by giving you at least 7 days' notice in writing. If we exercise this right, we shall refund you, on a pro rata basis, the prices paid by you that are for the portion of your Upgrade remaining after termination of your Upgrade occurs.

Bitrise shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

----

## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER

If we fail to comply with these Terms of Service, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms of Service or our negligence, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it is an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was contemplated by you and us at the time we entered into these Terms of Service.

We do not exclude or limit our liability for:

death or personal injury caused by our negligence;

fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or

any implied warranties, remedies or other liabilities not permitted to be excluded or limited under section 47 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

You agree that you shall be responsible to us for any losses that we suffer as a consequence of any breach by you of these Terms of Service.

If you use the Services or the Website for any commercial, business or re-sale purposes then:
you will be in breach of these Terms of Service; and

we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption or loss of business opportunity.

If the Services are defective and as a result the Services damage a device or digital content belonging to you, and this is caused by our failure to use reasonable care and skill, we will either repair the damage or pay you compensation. However, we will not be liable for damage which you could have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you free of charge or for damage which was caused by you failing to correctly follow installation instructions or to have in place the minimum system requirements as advised by us.

Our aggregate liability to you in respect of any loss or damage suffered and arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or for breach of statutory duty, or in any other way, shall not exceed an amount equal to the greater of (i) fees paid by you to Bitrise under this Agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action, or (ii) 1,000 Euros.

This clause 21 shall survive termination or expiry of these Terms of Service.

----

## GENERAL REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY

You acknowledge and agree that (i) your use of the Website will be in strict accordance with the Bitrise Privacy Notice (which can be accessed here https://www.bitrise.io/privacy), with this Agreement and with all applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of the Website will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.

----

## GOVERNING LAW

Subject to overriding provisions of mandatory laws of the jurisdiction of your domicile, this Agreement (and any further rules, policies, or guidelines incorporated by reference), and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.

Each party irrevocably agrees that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims). However, if you are a consumer you may have the right to claim jurisdiction in the country in which you reside.

----
## OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS

Each of the Clauses of these Terms of Service operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining clauses will remain in full force and effect.

If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms of Service, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
